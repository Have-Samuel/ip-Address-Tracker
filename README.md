## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [API](https://geo.ipify.org/docs)
- [MAP GENERATOR](LeafletJS)

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - This helped me Collect data for my App display. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](LeafletJS) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how the Maps and other features are displayed on the map while searching for the IP address. (`var marker = L.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map);`, `Circle`, `Polygons`) I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
