## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Screenshot

## Mobile Menu

## Desktop

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [API](https://geo.ipify.org/docs)
- [MAP GENERATOR](LeafletJS)

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - This helped me Collect data for my App display. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](LeafletJS) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how the Maps and other features are displayed on the map while searching for the IP address. (`var marker = L.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map);`, `Circle`, `Polygons`) I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
